## Cell-based Graduate Level 
This is a repository for storing my practice designs for preparing IC Contest.
You can find all the files, including testbench and EDA setting, for design are all in [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19oqxRfa3Rkcyp9X53_FMo_EjVwa661to?usp=drive_link)

Feel free to share your questions and ideas about the design with me.
I will be very happy to discuss with you. ^__^
Have a good day!

## Description for IC Contest
IC Contest is an annually held contest for university and graduate student to compete their chip design skills.
There are two categories, "Full Custom Design" and "Cell-based Digital Circuit Design".
The documents are fully described in Mandarin. Folks who speak other languages feel free to translate them.
The Cell-based design quiz is a great practice for people who want to train their design skills. 
It has detailed documents (spec) and fine-written testbenches and test environments. 
Allows engineers to concentrate on design.
